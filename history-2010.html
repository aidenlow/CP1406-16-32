<h1>History - 2010</h1>
<p>As promised, Ji Won Kim duly performed in our March Concert Romantic Interludes at the Riverway Arts Centre. This
    well attended concert featured Beethoven Violin Concerto with Ji Won giving a stunning performance. The concert
    also included Schubert’s Rosamunde Overture and the “unfinished” Symphony No. 8 by Schubert. Conductor was
    Professor John Hopkins.</p>

    <p>The string section of the Orchestra played at our major sponsor Queensland Nickel’s Open Day in May.</p>

    <p>In July we celebrated our 10th anniversary with a concert conducted by Richard McIntyre who also conducted the
        first Barrier Reef Orchestra ten years ago. This was an afternoon tea concert with table settings of ten at
        Jupiters Hotel Ballroom with high tea served at interval. It was a mixed program intended to suit the occasion
        with two pieces repeated from the first concert and highlighting the talents of nine local musicians as soloists
        including John Coulton from London on trumpet (but as an ex Pimlico High Student still counted as local).
        This concert was extremely well received and also included the distribution of the newly published 10 year
        commemorative history of the Orchestra prepared by Jean Dartnall.</p>

    <p>Our October concert featured the 2009 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Rebecca Chan.
        It was held at Dancenorth Studio with Professor John Hopkins conducting. Rebecca gave a memorable
        performance of Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4 and Vaughn Williams Lark Assending. The concert was at 5pm and
        titled Twilight Classics with a varied program including Delibes, Elgar and Grainger. An end of year BBQ
        followed for members and guests. As special guest performers we also had Pimlico Chamber Strings who gave
        a short recital which demonstrated the talents that won them the Queensland Fanfare Award for 2010. </p>
