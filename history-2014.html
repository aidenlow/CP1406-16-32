<h1>History - 2014</h1>
<p>I would like to thank all the players who together produced such excellent performances in 2013.
    Our audience is growing and the quality of our concerts is certainly one of the reasons for this.
    I would also like to acknowledge the hard working committee who do so much behind the scenes.
    Particular thanks are due to Alan Nixon who is now retiring after seven years as Secretary and
    to Annette Ellis who has been Treasurer for seven years and is continuing in that position.
    Special mention must also be made of Stephen Frewen-Lord’s continuing role as Concert Master
    and the tireless efforts of several rehearsal conductors.</p>

    <P>As I am now retiring as President this is my last report. Over the last five years it has been gratifying to
        see the Barrier Reef Orchestra make considerable progress. In 2009 the orchestra was in the doldrums. It was
        drawing an audience of 150 or less, had less than $10,000 in cash reserves and performed as an orchestra of
        about 40 players. In fact the mid year concert in 2009 was cancelled because we simply could not muster the
        players required for the concert program. We are now drawing a audience of 300 to 400 if not more, have cash
        reserves around $70,000 and field an orchestra of 60 to 70 players, depending on the program. We have also
        had a paid manager for several years and our current manager Sally Frewen-Lord has achieved organisational
        wonders. This transformation has occurred only because of the great effort that has been put in over years
        by managers, members both playing and non-playing, by committee members and by sponsors, supporters and
        philanthropists, so it is very much a team effort.</P>

    <p>I am confident that this enthusiasm and support will continue under Andrew Ryder’s presidency and the orchestra
        will retain and enhance its position as one of the leading organizations in Townsville’s arts community.</p>
