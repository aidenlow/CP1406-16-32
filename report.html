<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong>The main benefit from working in a group is the ability to share the workload. Each member can do what theyre confident with and this makes the overall product better then what it would have been</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong>Groups can be difficult to organize, and it only takes 1 member to not perform and it lets the group down. </p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong>It is very important to be clear of the overall goal. Also its important to delegate the work to each person and ensure that everyone knows what they need to get done. </p>
