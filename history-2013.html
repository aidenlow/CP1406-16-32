<h1>History - 2013</h1>
<p>n 2013 we staged three successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons. In March the “Works of Art” concert
    was a sellout at Riverway. Mussorgsky, Strauss and Haydn with conductor Mario Dobernig was well received
    by an appreciative audience.</p>
    <p>In August we had the well named “Contrasts” concert with conductor Raymond Yong and a program varying from
        Beethoven to Sculthorpe and featuring Elgar’s Cello Concerto with Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition
        winner Yoshika Masuda. This concert was also presented at the Burdekin Theatre, our first performance at
        another centre for many years. The concert was also notable for our collaboration with Umbrella Studio and
        ABC Open which resulted in a photo artists group forming to produce a video of images to accompany Schulthorpe’s
        Mangrove.</p>
    <p>We provided an ensemble to play at Anzac Park in September as part of the Bandstand Centenary event and then
        in October we presented Hats off to Gilbert and Sullivan. This was a quite demanding production devised and
        conducted by Richard McIntyre and involved 80 singers from North Queensland Opera and Music Theatre and
        Townsville Choral Society. The chorus combined with a sizable orchestra well and truly filled the Civic
        stage for what was essentially a Gilbert and Sullivan tribute show featuring excerpts from three operettas
        tied together by a narrator.</p>
    <p>2013 saw us maintain our membership numbers and our financial position remained strong. We cover approximately
        60% of our expenditure from box office income (which is considered to be very good by not-for-profit arts
        organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants, sponsorship and philanthropy.</p>
    <p>Townsville City Council continues to be our principal sponsor with a generous grant that covers our on-going
        core operational expenses. The Wheeler Family Charitable Gift Fund has also continued its strong support and
        it was pleasing to welcome Wilmar Sugar as a new sponsor in 2013. Wilmar are supporting us in our Burdekin
        performance initiative. Great in-kind support has continued from Sturt Business Centre, ASAP Printers, Signs
        of Excellence and the Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition.</p>
    <p>A new fund raising approach in 2013 was our Benefactors appeal. This has had a good start with 17 benefactors
        currently enrolled and the first renewals about to commence. I believe this particular avenue of fund raising
        will strengthen over time and prove to be a very reliable source of income provided it is proactively managed.</p>
    <p>2013 saw our first encouragement awards. Two young orchestra members – Craig Land and Lexie Gorton – each
        received a well deserved $500 award in recognition of their enthusiastic participation in the orchestra
        and their musical development. I am pleased that the committee is continuing the encouragement awards in 2014.</p>
