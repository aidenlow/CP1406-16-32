<h1>History - 2012</h1>
<p>2012 was a very successful year for the orchestra. We presented three concerts, one at Riverway Arts Centre and
    two at the Civic Theatre. Each was well received and well patronized – a total of 1,434 patrons between the three
    concerts. Not only is our audience increasing but so also is the orchestra itself – we have many new players and
    numbered 65 or more musicians on stage at each concert. Our general membership is also increasing and perhaps
    reflecting this trend (and the increasing workload) we now have an enthusiastic management committee that
    is twelve strong.</p>

    <p>The 2012 concert season was very varied. The March concert was conducted by our artistic director
        Richard McIntyre and was Russian themed – Prokopiev, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky. It featured
        Edwina George – the 2011 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner as violin soloist and we
        also had Sebastien Lipman from Brisbane on harp.</p>

    <p>In August we had our first concert with Mario Dobernig conducting. Mario has been rehearsing the orchestra
        for the last couple of days and will conduct the coming March concert and also the two musical interludes
        which we have for you today.</p>

    <p>The concert last August featured Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto with Raymond Yong on piano and also the New
        World Symphony. It was an excellent performance, very well received by the audience who insisted on an encore.</p>

    <p>The November concert was James Morrison Latin Fiesta. This concert was dreamed up by James Morrison and
        conductor Sean O’Boyle but is reworked for each performance and had previously been performed with the
        Queensland, Tasmanian and West Australian Orchestras. Our performance is the only one with a community
        orchestra. The concert was great fun for both the orchestra and the large audience. It was also particularly
        pleasing to welcome ten members of 1RAR band who joined us as musical partners in this performance.</p>
