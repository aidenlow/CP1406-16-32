<h1>History - 2011</h1>
<p>We have had a notable and rewarding year which saw the Orchestra include other arts groups to great advantage –
    three choirs, 1RAR Band and Townsville Cinema Group were all involved with us this year. The three concerts
    attracted a total of 1,457 patrons and two were full houses.</p>

    <p>On Tuesday, 16th August the great Beethoven 9th Symphony was played at Townsville Civic Theatre with Conductor
        David Lawrence and soloists from Brisbane and Mackay and the Spirit of the Voice Choir. A full house and a
        standing ovation. The young choristers of Allegretto choirs provided an entertaining first half before many
        proud parents and a receptive audience, this concert was however all about Beethoven’s 9th and under the
        enthusiastic, at times athletic, leadership of British Conductor David Lawrence the orchestra, soloists
        and the choir gave a dramatic performance.</p>

    <p>The concert was a major musical and logistical challenge presenting this great work for the first time in
        Townsville (probably for the first time anywhere in regional Australia). The concert attracted both new
        audience and new orchestra members and was a greatly rewarding experience for performers and audience alike.
        It also won the 2011 Performance of the Year trophy at the Townsville City Council Arts Awards.</p>

    <p>Our final concert had the Barrier Reef Orchestra Going to the Movies at Riverway Arts Centre. Orchestra Manager,
        Andrew Ryder was the originator and Conductor and it featured members of the 1 RAR Band and visual images were
        organised by Townsville Cinema Group</p>

    <p>A concert with a difference – performed in semi- darkness with both still and moving images projected to
        accompany the varied program of familiar and memorable movie music. Gabriel’s Oboe was a highlight as was
        the classic Tom and Jerry cartoon. A very well received concert, also one that drew many new faces.</p>

    <p>March this year had a Russian theme and the sold out concert at Riverway was conducted by our artistic patron,
        Richard McIntyre and featured 2011 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Edwina George playing
        the Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 2. It also had a small harp solo played by a special guest and international
        harpist Sebastien Lipman in the Nutcraker Suite by Tchaikovsky.</p>

    <p>A bonus concert was a recent as this last week when the Orchestra played the 1812 Overture at the Kapyong Day
        Official Parade along with the 1RAR Band and live cannons at Lavarack Barracks.</p>

    <p>In 2010 we appointed a paid part time manager; this has now run for two years and has proven most beneficial.
        Our first manager Andrew Ryder resigned after the October concert due to other work commitments and he has been
        replaced by Sally Frewen-Lord. I wish to thank Andrew for his great contribution to the year’s success.</p>

    <p>Our publicity has improved over the year with both the presentation and numbers of posters and banners
        increasing. The use of reuseable banners re-branded for each concert is proving to be a big saving.
        Another advance in 2011 was the acquisition of music scores and parts for a BRO repertoire. When these pieces
        can be included in the rehearsal schedule we will have the ability to fill unforeseen performance opportunities
        on quite short notice.</p>

    <p>Sponsorship support in 2011 was excellent and combined with good box office numbers has enabled us to further
        build up our cash reserves which two years ago were dangerously low.</p>

    <p>Queensland Nickle, Townsville City Council and the Wheeler Family Charitable Gift Fund have all continued
        their generous support of our core activities in 2011. Council funding was changed from an annual funding
        to a 3 year agreement.</p>

    <p>Two concerts this year had “concert sponsors”. RACQ sponsored the Beethoven 9th Symphony concert
        and RSL N.Q. District the Barrier Reef Orchestra Goes to the Movies concert. In both cases the
        respective organisation’s members received concession admission prices as part of the arrangement.</p>

    <p>We were also supported during the year with cash or in kind assistance from Kowari Motors, Signs of Excellence,
        ASAP Printers, Sturt Business Centre, The Keyboard Shop and Pimlico State High School</p>
    <p>Grants were received from RADF and the Breakwater Island Casino Community Benefit Fund – as well as the
        repertoire music mentioned before, the Orchestra now have six adjustable cello chairs. Our sincere thanks
        go to all of our sponsors and we look forward to their continuing support.</p>
